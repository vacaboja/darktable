    center view (default 350).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">don't use embedded preview JPEG but half-size raw</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Check this option to not use the embedded JPEG from the raw file but process the raw data.
    This is slower. (default off).
<!-- but prevents you from getting false impressions from camera-processed thumbnail -->
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">ask before removing images from database</bridgehead>

  </para>

<!--  
  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">maximum width of image drawing area</bridgehead>

  <para>

  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">maximum height of image drawing area</bridgehead>

  <para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">pen pressure control for brush masks</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Controls how the pressure reading of a graphics tablet impacts newly generated brush strokes
    (see <xref linkend="drawn_mask"/>). You can control the brush width, its hardness and its
    opacity. <quote>Absolute</quote> control means that the pressure reading directly defines
    the attribute with a value between 0% and 100%. <quote>Relative</quote> means that the
    pressure reading adjusts the attribute between zero and the pre-defined default value
    (default off).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">smoothing of brush strokes</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Sets the level for smoothing of brush strokes. Stronger smoothing leads to less nodes and
    easier editing at the expense of lower accuracy.
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">display of individual color channels</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Controls how individual color channels are displayed when activated in the parametric masks
    feature. You can choose between <quote>false color</quote> and <quote>grey scale</quote>

  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">only draw images on map that are currently collected and filtered</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Use the current filter settings to select the geotagged images drawn in the map view. This
    limits the images drawn to those currently shown in the filmstrip and thus reduces the time
    needed (default off).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">maximum number of images drawn on map</bridgehead>

  <para>
    The maximum number of geotagged images drawn on the map. Increasing this number can slow
    down the drawing of the map. Needs a restart if changed (default 100).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">pretty print the image location</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Show a more readable representation of the geo location in the image information module
    (default on).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">overlay txt sidecar over zoomed images</bridgehead>

  <para>
    When there is a text file next to an image it can be shown as an overlay over zoomed images
    on the lighttable. The text file has the same base name as the image file with file
    extension <quote>.txt</quote>. It either has to be there at import time or the crawler has
    to be enabled&nbsp;&ndash; see option <quote>look for updated xmp files on startup</quote>
    in <xref linkend="core_options"/> (default off).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">expand a single lighttable module at a time</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Controls how lighttable panels are expanded. If this option is enabled, expanding a panel by
    <emphasis>clicking</emphasis> collapses any currently expanded panel. If you want to expand
    a panel without collapsing the others you do so with <emphasis>shift-click</emphasis>.
    Disabling this option reverts the meaning of <emphasis>click</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>shift-click</emphasis> (default off).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">expand a single darkroom module at a time</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Controls how darkroom modules are expanded. If this option is enabled, expanding a module by
    <emphasis>clicking</emphasis> collapses any currently expanded module. If you want to expand
    a module without collapsing the others you do so with <emphasis>shift-click</emphasis>.
    Disabling this option reverts the meaning of <emphasis>click</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>shift-click</emphasis> (default on).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">scroll to lighttable modules when expanded/collapsed</bridgehead>

  <para>
    With this option enabled the lighttable side panels will scroll a module to the top when it
    is expanded or collapsed (default off).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">scroll to darkroom modules when expanded/collapsed</bridgehead>

  <para>
    With this option enabled the darkroom side panel will scroll a module to the top when it is
    expanded or collapsed (default on).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">border around image in darkroom mode</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Process the image in darkroom mode with a small border of the given number of pixels
    (default 20).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">do high quality processing for slideshow</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Controls how images are processed for the slideshow view. It this option is enabled, the
    image will first be processed in full resolution, and downscaled at the very end. This can
    result in better quality sometimes, but will always be slower (default on).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">rating an image one star twice will not zero out the rating</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Normally clicking a one star rating twice will set a zero star rating to that image. When
    checking this option a second click on a one star rating will keep that rating (default
    off).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">method to use for getting the display profile</bridgehead>

  <para>
    This option allows to force a specific way of getting the current display profile for color
    management (see <xref linkend="rendering_method"/>). In the default setting
    <quote>all</quote> darktable will either query the X display server's xatom or the
    <emphasis>colord</emphasis> system service. You can set this option to <quote>xatom</quote>
    or <quote>colord</quote> to enforce a specific method if the alternative gives wrong
    results.
  </para>
